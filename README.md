# 👋 Welcome to Keyboards and Chaos

Hi, I’m Lindsey — the mind behind `keyboardsandchaos`.

I'm a data analyst in progress with a background in revenue management, medical billing, and coding. I'm passionate about using **data to uncover mysteries**, **automate boring stuff**, and **solve real-world problems** — especially in areas that intersect with **cybersecurity**, **ethical hacking**, and **defending the vulnerable.**

---

## 🔍 What I’m Working On

- Building portfolio projects using **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, and "Tableau
- Exploring the intersection of **data analytics and red team tactics**
- Learning more about **ETL pipelines**, **data cleaning**, and **visual storytelling**
- Studying cybersecurity concepts (with an eye on where data meets defense)

---

## 🧰 Tech & Tools I Use

- **Languages**: SQL and Python 
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy  
- **Tools**: Power BI, Tableau, Excel, Git/GitHub  
- **Currently exploring**: Wireshark, Burp Suite, basic scripting for red team workflows

---

## 🌱 Always Learning

- How to detect anomalies with data  
- Building clean, clear dashboards  
- Where cybersecurity and data analytics overlap  
- How to tell better stories with charts (and less chaos)

---

## 📌 Featured Projects (Coming Soon)

- `claim-cleaner`: Automating healthcare billing checks with Python  
- `payload-and-pandas`: An exploratory notebook on cyber logs + data analysis  
- `dash-of-defense`: A Power BI dashboard inspired by red team operations

Let’s connect, collaborate, and make sense of the chaos.
